# ML_Regression
Machine Learning Regression is a technique for investigating the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome. It's used as a method for predictive modelling in machine learning, in which an algorithm is used to predict continuous outcomes
## How is regression used in machine learning-
Regression analysis is one of the most basic tools in the area of machine learning used for prediction. Using regression you fit a function on the available data and try to predict the outcome for the future or hold-out datapoints.
## What is the concept of regression-
A regression is a statistical technique that relates a dependent variable to one or more independent (explanatory) variables. A regression model is able to show whether changes observed in the dependent variable are associated with changes in one or more of the explanatory variables.
